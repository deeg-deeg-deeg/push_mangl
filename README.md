# push_mangl

push_mangl!
modified version of the script mangl
by @justmat
to work with a push 1 controller

this script uses a modified
version of the "pushy" library
by @ericmoderbacher

mangl is based on the script angl
by @tehn and the
engine/script glut
by @artfwo

thanks to @ericmoderbacher who made this 
project possible thanks to his work on
creating a push 1 library!
And to everyone else contributing to the
norns community!

-----------------------------------------

This version is far from commplete, there 
are tons of buttons with no function and
a lot of room for your ideas!
Feel free to take this code as a starting
point for your Push 1 project.

This is just the version I wanted and does
all the stuff I needed to perform with 
my Ableton Push and Norns.

I think it is also very easy to cut the 
mangl code parts out and use this with
something totally different. I annotated
as much code as I could, so you (hopefully) 
should be able to understand everything.

-----------------------------------------

Here is an overview of the layout and
functions I am using

And this is an overview of the midi 
message numbers send by Push 1

The color of the pads can be changed in 
the script (at line 540) by changing
the value of the variable called "color"
In the picture are some values and their
according colors
